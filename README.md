# eat-da-burger


This App is designed to let you enter, and then virtually **devour** your favorite (or least favorite) burgers. 

You can do any of the following:
  - enter a new burger of your choice
  - eat a burger
  - re-order a previously entered burger
  - delete an entered burger (not eat it, but 'send it back')

When you open the application, you should see something like this:

-Add a burger under "Add a Burger"--decide when it goes in if it it goes in devoured or still up for grabs. . .
- eat a burger by clicking on "Go on, eat it, you know you want to. . ." in any burger entry.
- order another burger of the same type by clicking the 'Order another?' button in the Devoured list.
- Delete any entry by pressing the button called "DELETE!"
